Attempt to recreate the dead countdown from that one movie with javascript

<a href="https://pandadiestro.github.io/Countdown-bootleg/Code%20n%20stuff/" target="_blank"><strong>This is the link to see it ðŸ˜ˆ</strong></a>

Disclaimer: this is literally just a backwards timer that starts from a random place it **totally should be used as just a joke and in no way serious stuff**, that said i do not own the commercial concept of the dead countdown, only the code shown here.

Attempt to recreate the dead countdown from that one movie with javascript

[**This is the link to see it in the job ðŸ˜ˆ**](https://pandadiestro.github.io/Countdown-bootleg/Code%20n%20stuff/)

Disclaimer: this is literally just a backwards timer that starts from a random place it **totally should** be used as just a joke and in no way serious stuff, that said i do not own the commercial concept of the dead countdown, only the code shown here.

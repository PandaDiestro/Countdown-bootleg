[**This is the link to see it 😈**](https://pandadiestro.github.io/Countdown-bootleg/Code%20n%20stuff/){target="_blank"}

Disclaimer: this is literally just a backwards timer that starts from a random place it **totally should be used as just a joke and in no way serious stuff**, that said i do not own the commercial concept of the dead countdown, only the code shown here.
